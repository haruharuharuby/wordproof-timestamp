Timestamp your WordPress content on the blockchain for protection and trust. No blockchain knowledge required.

== Description ==

### WordProof: Timestamp your WordPress Content on the Blockchain

With WordProof Timestamp, you can timestamp your WordPress content on any EOSIO blockchain from the comfort of your WordPress site. No prior blockchain experience necessary: either manually timestamp your content or activate automatic timestamps.

### Why do I need to timestamp my content?

WordProof Timestamp does everything in its power to bring the benefits of blockchain to your WordPress website. Here are some reasons why you should timestamp your content:

- Copyright protection
- Transparency: increase trust and claim authenticity
- Next-generation SEO benefits
- Proof of existance at certain moments in time
- Prepare for upcoming EU regulations
- Be your own notary

### Features

- Automatically timestamp your content on the blockchain
- Show the blockchain certificate pop-up on your website
- Downloadable blockchain certificate as proof of existence
- Copyright Infringement Claim Tools
- Revision Management

### How does WordProof Timestamp work?

Timestamping creates a unique and universal fingerprint (called the hash) for every piece of content. If the input changes even the slightest, the hash becomes totally different.

This hash is added to the blockchain with a date and time. Because you have the input that results in this specific hash, you can prove that you had the content at that point in time.
